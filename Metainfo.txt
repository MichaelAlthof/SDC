Name of QuantLet : InterSwap

Published in: 

Description: Four Ethereum Smart Contracts written in Solidity. Oracle.sol provides Oracle information for the SDC based on a Provable Sample. SafeMath.sol provides basic mathematical functions for the SDC to run. Swap.sol is the SDC itself calling Oracle.sol and SafeMath.sol. Factory.sol is the frontend to check for new SDC's, i.e. \cf2 \outl0\strokewidth0 standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem. ABI is the Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) for the Factory.sol frontend.
